**Unit 1: C++ and Java** <span id="1"></span> 
*Having completed* [*CS101: Introduction to Computer Science
I*](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs101/)*, you should have a strong
grasp of Java and its uses and a basic understanding of Object-Oriented
Programming. This course will employ both Java and C++, another
industry-standard programming language. In this unit, we will outline
the similarities and differences between these two languages, noting how
each is used in the industry. We will also take an in-depth look at the
history, importance, and functionality of C++ and compare the basic
building blocks of each language in order to draw a distinction between
the two and further acquaint you with both languages.*
