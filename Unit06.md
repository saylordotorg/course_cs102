**Unit 6: Searching and Sorting** <span id="6"></span> 
*As a computer programmer, you will need to know how to search and sort
data. This will require you to leverage what you have learned in a
number of different Computer Science areas, drawing from your
introduction to data structures and algorithms in particular. In this
unit, we will identify the importance of searching and sorting, learn a
number of popular searching and sorting algorithms, and determine how to
analyze and appropriately apply them. By the end of this unit, you will
recognize instances in which you need a searching or sorting algorithm
and be able to apply one efficiently.*

-   **Lecture: Khan Academy’s “Exercise - Write a Sorting Function,”
    “Insertion Sort Algorithm,” “Insertion Sort in Python,” “Stepping
    through Insertion Sort Function,” and “Simpler Insertion Sort
    Function”**
    Link: Khan Academy’s [“Exercise - Write a Sorting
    Function”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49F_nk-gXs), [“Insertion
    Sort
    Algorithm”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxNnP2gNgb8&feature=youtu.be),
    [“Insertion Sort in
    Python”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMReVRg_dmU&feature=youtu.be),

    Function”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO_9L_1qxuE&feature=youtu.be),
    and [“Simpler Insertion Sort
    Function”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZn-p5XHZXo&feature=youtu.be)
    (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the first link above and watch the lecture
    (4 minutes). It specifies the requirements for the program. Again,
    our focus in this series of short lectures is not the syntax of the
    programming language used (i.e., Python), but the design (or
    algorithm) of the program and the data structures used. Watch the
    second video (8 minutes), which designs the program. This design
    makes use of the list data structure and For and While control
    constructs.  
      
     Next, watch the third video (9 minutes), which implements the
    design in Python - the simple procedural and object-oriented
    language used in the Khan lectures. Then, watch the fourth video (12
    minutes), which verifies the Python design and implementation by
    stepping through the program, line by line and function call by
    function call. Note that comments are used within the program to
    document design and implementation decisions or choices.  
      
     Finally, watch the fifth video (3 minutes). This video demonstrates
    the next stage of the programming process. Previously, we
    demonstrated the requirements, design, implementation, and
    verification stages of programming. The next stage illustrated in
    this lecture is maintenance. There are two types of maintenance:
    fixing bugs or errors in the program, and enhancements. This lecture
    enhances the program by improving its efficiency (relative to the
    number of statements used).  
      
     Watching these lectures and taking notes should take approximately
    1 hour.

    listen as the instructor explains Big O notation. As you watch these
    slides, you will understand that Big O describes the effect of the

    instructor explains how the complexity of an algorithm is computed
    by giving a simple example and walking through the steps needed to
    find the complexity of a function.
