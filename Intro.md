Course Syllabus for "CS102: Introduction to Computer Science II"
----------------------------------------------------------------

This course is a continuation of the first-semester course titled
[CS101: Introduction to Computer Science
I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs101/). It will introduce you to a
number of more advanced Computer Science topics, laying a strong
foundation for future academic study in the discipline. We will begin
with a comparison between Java - the programming language utilized last
semester - and C++, another popular, industry-standard programming
language. We will then discuss the fundamental building blocks of
Object-Oriented Programming, reviewing what we learned last semester and
familiarizing ourselves with some more advanced programming concepts.
The remaining course units will be devoted to various advanced topics,
including the Standard Template Library, Exceptions, Recursion,
Searching and Sorting, and Template Classes. By the end of the class,
you will have a solid understanding of Java and C++ programming, as well
as a familiarity with the major issues that programmers routinely
address in a professional setting.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Demonstrate an understanding of the concepts of Java and C++ and how
    they are used in Object-Oriented Programming;
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the history and development of
    Object-Oriented Programming;
-   Explain the importance of the C++ Standard Template Library and how
    basic components are used;
-   Demonstrate a basic understanding of the importance of run-time
    analysis in programming;
-   Demonstrate an understanding of important sorting and search
    routines in programming;
-   Demonstrate a detailed understanding of generic programming and
    principles in the standard template library;
-   Demonstrate an understanding of various types used within the
    standard template library in C++;
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the generic usage of templates in
    programming for C++ and Java; and
-   Compare and contrast the features of Java and C++.

### Course Information

Welcome to CS102.  General information on the course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Charles Lively and Yongge Wang  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following resources:  

-   Stanford University: Julie Zelenski [“About the C++
    Language”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7pMi7-wro8)
-   Bell Laboratories: Dennis M. Ritchie’s [“The Development of the C
    Language”](http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html)
-   University of Western Australia: Rowan Davies’
    [“](http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html)Introduction to
    Functional Programming”
-   Hobart and William Smith Colleges: David Eck’s Introduction to
    Programming Using Java: [“Introduction to Correctness and
    Robustness”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/cs102-4.1.11.pdf)
-   YouTube: Khan Academy’s [“Recursive Factorial
    Function”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o920mj0NbhE)
-   University of Ottawa: Robert C. Holte’s [“Recursive
    Definitions”](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~holte/T26/rec-defs.html)
-   University of Helsinki: Juha Karkkainen’s [“STL
    Functors”](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/tpkarkka/alglib/k06/lectures/functors.html)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials,
including the quizzes and the final exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of 110.2 hours
to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you
plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you 18.5 hours. Perhaps you can sit down
with your calendar and decide to complete Subunit 1.1 (a total of 4
hours) on Monday night, Subunit 1.2 (a total of 6 hours) on Tuesday and
Wednesday nights, and so forth.
