**Unit 2: The Building Blocks of Object-Oriented Programming** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Now that you are familiar with both C++ and Java, you are ready to
explore more advanced topics in Object-Oriented (OO) Programming. We
will begin by discussing the motivation behind programming with objects,
learning the essential characteristics of OO Programming languages and
identifying the advantages and disadvantages of various major
programming frameworks. The unit will also provide a general history of
OO Programming and, finally, review major characteristics of OO
Programming. By the end of this unit, you will be able to discuss
different programming paradigms and identify the main properties of OO
Programming. *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 15 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 7 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 7 hours  
  
 ☐    Assessment: 1 hour

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the various programming paradigms
    within computer science; and
-   Demonstrate a detailed understanding of the principle concepts
    involved in object-oriented programming without regard to any
    particular programming language.
