**Unit 7: Template Programming** <span id="7"></span> 
*In Unit 3, we discussed the C++ Standard Template Library and
introduced the concept of template programming. In this unit, we will
further explore both templates and generic programming, cultivating a
broader understanding of the topic. We will begin with a review of the
STL and a discussion of the motivation behind template development. We
will then discuss templates in a more generic fashion, referring back to
the STL where necessary, and take a look at how templates are utilized
within Java, comparing and contrasting with the C++ STL. By the end of
this unit, you will recognize the importance of templates, be able to
identify when they are needed, and know how to apply them efficiently.*
