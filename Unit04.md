**Unit 4: Exceptions** <span id="4"></span> 
*A programmer must ensure the safe execution of his or her code. In
other words, if an error occurs, the program should present the user
with relevant information and then quit gracefully. The built-in C++
structures used to accomplish this goal are known as “Exceptions.” This
unit will introduce you to the concept of throwing and catching
Exceptions when something goes wrong with your software, explain how
they are used in both C++ and Java, and teach you how to handle them. By
the end of this unit, you will be able to write safe programs designed
to perform gracefully when/if errors occur.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the roles of exceptions and
    exception handling in programming;
-   Demonstrate an understanding of how exceptions are handled in
    various programming languages, including C++ and Java; and
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the differences as to how exceptions
    are handled in C++ and Java with regards to syntax.
